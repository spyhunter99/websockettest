# Web Socket Test

A very simple example of working with websockets with Java + Tomcat

Tested with Tomcat 8 but it probably works with Tomcat 7 too.

Assumes Tomcat is running in port 8080, if you change it, you'll have to change
some of the Javascript code too. This example is larger based on the examples of others.
